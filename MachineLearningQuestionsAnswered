Data programming through labeling functions generating training sets from data


***Basic MAchine Learning Models:

1) Linear (linear regression and SVM)   (if data is linearly separated)

2) Tree based  (Decision tree and random forest, cat boost, gradient boosting--very powerful----predictions of the individual trees are summed)  (Linear relationship is hard to capture)  (Divide and conquer approach can wrk with non-linear data as well)

3) KNN (need feature scaling as distance calculated)(---idea behind it closer objects have same labels)

4) Neural networks


******Feature Encoding

1)Tree based 
In tree based label encoder or factorize can be used tbut dummtencoding is wastage of efoort. XGBoost can handle NA VAlues.

2)Non tree based model
In non tree neural networks,linear regression dummy encoding as weell as feature scaling[0-1 minmaxscalar] is necessary also for K_Nearest_Neighbour.

**Checking null values check by plotting histogram if one value say -1 has a tall bar from rest of data indicating outlier. 

**use Label encoder(numeric encoding)  with tree based models as if(male==1) not matters but not with regression as weitage increses one hot-encoding is best with non tree based models
