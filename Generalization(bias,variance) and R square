Generalization refers to how well the concepts learned by a machine learning model 

apply to specific examples not seen by the model
Undeft refers to a model that can neither model the training data nor generalize to 

new data.

A model underfits when it is too simple with regards to the data it is trying to 

model.
Your model is underfitted when you have a high bias.


A model underfits when it is too simple with regards to the data it is trying to 

model.

One way to detect such situation is to use the biasâ€“variance approach, which can 

represented like this:

enter image description here

Your model is underfitted when you have a high bias.

To know whether you have a too high bias or a too high variance, you view the 

phenomenon in terms of training and test errors:

high training and testing error = high bias (underfitting)    sol = increase the model 

complexity
low training error while high testing error(large gap between tra and tes error)= high 

variance(overfitting)    sol= add more data

"Coefficient of Determination" R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the 

data are to the fitted regression line=  1-SSE(sum of squared errors)
R square will always increase adding our variable.

best fit=1-0=1
